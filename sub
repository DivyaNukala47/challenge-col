This project is a simple frontend-only chat application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The structure starts with HTML, which creates the layout of the app. It has a chat container that includes a header, a chat display area, and an input section for typing messages. The CSS styles make the chat look clean and modern, with different background colors for user messages (greenish) and bot messages (gray), rounded corners, shadows, and a fixed size box. The JavaScript part handles the main functionality. When the user types a message and clicks "Send" (or presses Enter), the sendMessage() function captures the text, displays it in the chat window as a user message, and then simulates a bot reply after a short delay. The addMessage() function dynamically creates and adds new message elements to the chat box, keeping the scroll at the bottom so the latest message is always visible. The bot’s responses are generated by a simple rule-based function generateBotResponse(), which looks for keywords like "hello," "how are you," or "bye" and gives fixed replies; otherwise, it says it doesn’t know how to respond. Overall, this project demonstrates basic DOM manipulation, event handling, and conditional logic in JavaScript, making it a beginner-friendly mini-project that can be expanded into a real chat app with backend or AI integration.
